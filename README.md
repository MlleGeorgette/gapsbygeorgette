Hiya! 

Welcome to my portfolio of small projects. In this portfolio, I complete tasks based on what I've learnt in my AI & Data Science course with the aid of independent research. These projects show that I have grasped the basics of Python including, but not limited to, creating and calling functions, manipulating csv files, and working with data from user input.
